## Getting Started

To use the TCA-Net Discord bot, you'll need to set up a `.env` file with the following variables:

**Mandatory Variables:**

- `channelId`: Specify the ID of the Discord channel where the bot will send reminders.

**Optional Variable:**
- `delta`: Set the number of minutes before the bot sends reminders for the next course. The default is 15 minutes.

```bash
authToken=Dht5bWVhdWNvdTpNMWNrM3lpbnNhLmZy
discordToken=MTE1OTU5MTU0MzUxOTMxNDA5Mg.Gggz7B.hcSKPwda8GCysq7TRI7xv_HW0_7HyVnz3jgd25

## How it works

### files descriptions :
**crawler.py** will scrap the calendar based on the "tc-net" site.
It will create 3 files wich contain the objects :
- professors.pkl : contains the list of professors
- rooms.pkl : contains the list of rooms
- courses.pkl : contains the list of courses

**discordBot.py** will use the 3 files as a DB to send the correct reminder messages on discord.
